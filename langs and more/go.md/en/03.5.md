# 3.5 Summary

In this chapter, we introduced HTTP, DNS resolution flow and how to build a simple web server. Then we talked about how Go implements web servers for us by looking at the source code of the `net/http` package.

I hope that you now know much more about web development, and you should see that it's quite easy and flexible to build a web application in Go.
