# 5.7 Summary

In this chapter, you first learned about the design of the `database/sql` interface and many third-party database drivers for various database types. Then I introduced beedb, an ORM for relational databases, to you. I also showed you some sample database operations. In the end, I talked about a few NoSQL databases. We saw that Go provides very good support for those NoSQL databases.

After reading this chapter, I hope that you have a better understanding of how to operate databases in Go. This is the most important part of web development, so I want you to completely understand the design concepts of the `database/sql` interface.
